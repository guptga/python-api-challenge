# python-api-challenge

**Background**


Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?


Part I - WeatherPy
A Python script iscreated  to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

Observation

Southern Hemisphere has more oceans than land, hence, it has milder climate than the northern hemisphere.

Part II - VacationPy


In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.

Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.

To succeed on this deliverable of the assignment, open the VacationPy.ipynb starter code and complete the following steps:

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21

Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s

Zero cloudiness

NOTE
Feel free to adjust your specifications but make sure to set a reasonable limit to the number of rows returned by your API requests.

Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.

Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map as in the following image:
